#You can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the range()
#function. For example, consider how you might make a list of the first 10
#square numbers (that is, the square of each integer from 1 through 10). In
#Python, two asterisks (**) represent exponents. Hereâ€™s how you might put
#the first 10 square numbers into a list:

squares = []
for value in range (1, 11):
    square = value ** 2
    squares.append(square)
print (squares)

###########################################
#To write this code more concisely, omit the temporary variable square
#and append each new value directly to the list:

squares = []
for value in range(1,11):
    squares.append(value**2)
print(squares)

#Simple Statistics with a List of Numbers
digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,0]

minimum = min(digits)
maximum = max(digits)
summary = sum(digits)

print (minimum)
print (maximum)
print (summary)

#List comprehensions

squares = [value ** 2 for value in range (1,11)]
print (squares)
